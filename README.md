# Distributed Systems Portfolio
The goal of this repository is to store small examples of distributed system architectures, using APIs and mobile development.

## For each directory
Inside each one of the directories there's an architecture that agregates more than one system. 
### Examples:
- ___Android application and Ruby API, where the Android App makes requests to the Ruby API_ | (Android -> Ruby API) | __;
- ___Android application, Ruby API and Django API, where the Android App makes requests to the Ruby API, and the Ruby API makes requests to the Django API_ | (Android -> Ruby API -> Django API) | __.
