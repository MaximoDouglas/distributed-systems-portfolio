# Distributed Systems Portfolio
The goal of this repository is to store small examples of distributed systems architectures, using APIs and mobile development.

## For each directory
Inside each one of the directories there's an architecture that agregates more than one system, e.g. ___Android application and Ruby API, where the Android App makes requests to the Ruby API___. Other architectures may be found too, something like the last example but the Ruby API makes requests to a Django API.
